# User-Story 
I am a person who previously cooked the same dishes for years. I'd like to add variety to my diet by experimenting with meal options. When I click "Select your meal type" I am presented with options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and teatime. When I select "SHOW RECIPE!", I am presented with a new dish I can try with note of its name, the required ingredients and other health factors such as calorie count, vegetarian status, allergen awareness and more. If I choose the "RESET" button, my meal type selection will reset.
